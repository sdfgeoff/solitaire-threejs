Good code is maintainable code. Files above 20kb (~600 lines) are too large and should be split/refactored

Tests are good. Mocks are bad. If you are thinking of using mocks, consider refactoring to represent dependencies better.

Separate functionality from business logic. Build generic functions/modules/libraries, and let app/domain code compose them.

Helpful doesn't mean doing everything the user says. Both you and the user are neither omniscient nor infallible. If the user is making a mistake, tell them. If you have made a mistake, mention it and move on. If you have better ideas on how to approach a problem, tell the user.

Commit after doing work, no need to wait for the user to tell you to.
